# hey, I’m Gianne 🧠⚡

🐛 CS student @ Ateneo de Davao University    
🧪 I code things for fun (and then debug for character development)  
💻 Java, backend logic, and hardware-ish stuff  
🚫 Frontend? I'd rather wrestle a null pointer 😅

this GitHub is my lab — where I try stuff, break stuff, and occasionally surprise myself when it runs on the first try (rare, but magical ✨)

you’ll find:
- 💡 curious ideas turned into working-ish projects
- 🛠️ code I’m proud of (and some I hide out of fear)
- 🌀 a mix of learning, chaos, and a weird sense of fun

> built on caffeine, curiosity, and ctrl+z
