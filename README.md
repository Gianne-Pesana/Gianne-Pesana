# Hey there, I’m Gianne 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — where half-baked ideas turn into slightly more-baked projects.

I’m a Computer Science student at Ateneo de Davao (still figuring out how computers actually *work*, but we're getting there). I like building things that make sense, break things that don’t, and occasionally write code that even works on the first try. Rare, but it happens.

## What am I doing here?

Mostly:
- 🧪 **Experimenting** – Trying things just to see what happens.
- 💻 **Learning** – Because Google and Stack Overflow haven’t blocked me yet.
- 🛠️ **Building** – Stuff that interests me, or just to make life slightly easier or weirder.
- 😄 **Having fun** – Because if it’s not fun, then it’s just... debugging.

## What I like:
- Java, hardware, and tech things that click (both literally and conceptually).
- Clean code and messy desks.
- Solving real problems (or fake ones I made up to feel productive).
- Not frontend. Please no frontend. (UI/UX people: I respect you, but I fear your tools.)

## Projects?
They're around here somewhere. Some are serious. Most are silly. All of them helped me learn something (even if it’s just what *not* to do).

## Contributions welcome?

Sure, if you're as curious (or confused) as I am — let's learn (and break stuff) together.

Thanks for dropping by. Star something if it made you smile. Or don’t. I won’t cry (probably).
