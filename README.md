# yo, I’m Gianne 🧃

First-year CS student.  
Code enthusiast.  
Front-end avoider (for everyone’s safety).  

This GitHub’s my digital playground — expect random projects, weird ideas, and the occasional "aha!" moment.  
I’m here to **learn**, **experiment**, and most importantly, **have fun**. (If it breaks, that’s part of the process.)

💬 Java is my current language of choice.  
🛠️ I like tech that makes sense and stuff that doesn’t — I’ll probably build both.  
⚠️ No fancy portfolio here. Just honest, hands-on chaos.
